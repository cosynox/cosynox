Specification:

HTML

HTML-Tags, that I have used besides 
<html><head><body> and <title>:
<link>
<script>
<header>
<main>
<p>
<pre>
<code>
<form>
<input>
<ul>
<li>
<a href...>
<footer>
<h4>
<div>
<img>
<address>
<br>

CSS

As different CSS selectors I used:
.centered
.left
.right
to position my text according to the class names. 
There I used the property text-align
Then I used the classes
.large
.medium
.small
to exactly specify the points of the font-sizeand the line-height
I had the idea to use a 12 pt font for normal text, a 24 pt font
for large text and a 8 pt font for small text. 
My idea is to have a very traditional layout, like on a A4
paper page. And so I modified the body tag to use a 12 pt 
Helvetica font as a standard and a line-height of 24 pt. That 
means that I get a 1.5 lines distance between the lines. 
Everywhere I worked with a 1.5 lines distance. So I ensured a 
very good readability of the text. 
My standard should be A4 width and a 12 pt font and 1,5 lines
distance between the lines.
body
I used the attributes
font-family
color
width
padding
margin
and I defined the fonts in the 
header
main
footer
with the attributes
font-size
line-height
Special considerations I had to make for the redefinition
of the code and the pre tag because bootstrap destroyed 
all my formatting. It was not easy to get back the Courier
font, my color and a normal appearance of the code.
I used the attributes
overflow-y to eliminate the scroll bootstrap
and with the attributes
font-family
font-size and
line-height I tried to get back a normal appearance of
the code. 
I used the color #800000 to get a distinct visual appearance
of the code that is still good readable and a web safe color.
With 
padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left
I tried to overwrite the mess that bootstrap caused on my page.

Then I modified the li - tag in order to make it possible
to give the menu item of the page that I am just visiting
a read dot. When the li - tag has the attribute class="a" 
then it should become read. For that I used the 
color
attribute. 

And I modified the ul - tag so that it creates a menu with
a gray background and a box, and it hovers over the menu items.
I made a class="menu" attribute.

In order to indicate that a selection makes no sense, I modified
the a - tag and invented a class attribute "grayed".

I modified the <p>-tag with a class="small" to make it possible 
to have small letters.

Javascript

Concerning javascript, I made a function that greets the
visitor on the page with his name.

And I write at the end of each page the name of the file and 
date and time when the page has been delivered.

Bootstrap 

I used bootstrap to especially layout the file curriculum.html
in a two column layout that suits for a personal data sheet.

Bootstrap was also used to style the images in various files.

Bootstrap was everywhere used in the body with the 
class="container" to enable a flexible display when a smaller
display would be used. At least as far as possible. I normally
would want a A4 layout.

Bootstrap has disturbed my layout of code in the <code>-tag. 
It makes things, that I don't want. For example, it indents 
the code regardless of what I define in my own stylesheet.
I have found no way to get around this.
