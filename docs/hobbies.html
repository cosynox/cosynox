                    <p>
                        I have several hobbies. These are, among others, 
                        photograpy, bicycling with my electric bicycle and since 
                        some time now again computer programming. Every day I am 
                        cooking my own meal and I like to do that also very much. 
                        I have a lot of cookbooks and I experiment with the 
                        recipes. And I am sitting always when the wheather allows 
                        it on the little terrace in front of my appartment, often 
                        together with neighbours, having a coffee and talking 
                        about the world.
                    </p>

                            Photography
                        </h4>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since long time, photography has become one of my favourite 
                        hobbies. In the analog times, photography has been too 
                        expensive for me to become a hobby, but since the 2000s 
                        when photography became affordable and digital, I 
                        discovered that as a hobby for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the beginning, I had a little camera from Hewlett
                        Packard, but then I bought a used Canon 350D camera. This 
                        camera accompanied me a very long time. Now I have a 
                        Canon 650D camera. I have bought the 650D not because I 
                        could make better photos with it, but because it has the 
                        possibility to make videos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img    src="images/butterfly_objective.png"
                        class="rounded mx-auto d-block"
                        width="480"
                        alt="butterfly on objective lens">
                    </p>
                        I have a lot of good photos, perhaps one day I'll publish 
                        a collection of them. Since 2020, I have also made a lot 
                        of videos with the camera. 
                    <p>
                    <p>
                        When I use my photos, I don't like to manipulate them.
                        I only change the exposure if needed or I take a picture 
                        detail and that is all of manipulation that I make on
                        the photos.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I use my e-bike every day. It is my main means of traffic. 
                        Before I had the bicycle, I often used the train and the 
                        bus, but since I have bought the e-bike in 2020, I only 
                        use the bicycle for local traffic.

                    <p>
                        In the time of the year with good wheather I like to make
                        bicycle tours to the surrounding places.

                        In the last time I have again very much fun in computer 
                        programming. Although I have been developing software 
                        professionally and some time couldn't stand seeing 
                        computer programs in my free time, I have rediscovered
                        this skill as something very valuable for me. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So it has become again one of my hobbies. I was even able 
                        to make successfully a course in Python programming at 
                        CS50. This I want to continue. I am very interested in 
                        the developments in the field of artificial intelligence.

                        I can extend my gallery of courses because
                        I have finished the course CS50's Introduction to Computer
                        Science in May 2025.

                        It is especially good, I think, to take these courses
                        online. I can learn just in my own rhythm.

                        My favourite programming language is C, because it is so
                        clear and it is the swiss army knife of programming. What
                        I also like is the language Pascal.
