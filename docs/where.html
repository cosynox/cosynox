                    In order to say it exactly,
                    I am living 49°12'24.0"N 8°04'40.8"E.
                    That is the coordinate that Google maps told me when I
                    had lost and found again my smartphone. You can look it
                    up on the map. That is in the south west of Germany,
                    about 25 kilometers (about 15 miles) from the french
                    border.

                <p>
                    I am living in the village Godramstein. Godramstein
                    belongs since 1972 to the city of Landau and is a part of
                    it.

                    On the picture you see in the foreground the village
                    Godramstein, then in the middle you see the city of
                    Landau, and then the valley of the river Rhine. In the
                    background you see the Black Forest.

                    Here, where I am living, I am surrounded by wine
                    yards. The wine is the most important agrarian
                    product here.

                    Nearby is the Palatinate Forest which is a
                    designated nature park.

                <p>
                    Famous is the Trifels Castle, where Richard the
                    Lionheart, King of England, was imprisoned after the
                    Third Crusade in the year 1193.

                    What I like most are the very good nearby possibilities
                    to go for a walk in the nature.

                    Nearby is situated the train station of Godramstein. Here
                    goes the train between the cities of Pirmasens and Landau.

                    From my appartment I can see the train station, the trains,
                    and I have a wide view over the Palatinate Forest. Here
                    one can see a train going during sunset.
